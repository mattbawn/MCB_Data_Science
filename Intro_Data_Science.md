```
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves the collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation of large and complex data sets, as well as the communication of insights and findings to stakeholders. Data Science draws on techniques and theories from fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science to extract meaningful information from data. The goal of Data Science is to understand patterns, relationships, and insights hidden in the data, and to use this understanding to support decision-making and problem-solving in various domains such as business, healthcare, and social sciences.
