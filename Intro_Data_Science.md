# What is Data Science?

## Some Definitions

If we ask an [AI](https://openai.com/) what data science is, we get the following explanation:


*Data Science is an **interdisciplinary field** that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to **extract knowledge** and insights from structured and unstructured **data**. It involves the **collection**, **processing**, **analysis**, and **interpretation** of large and complex data sets, as well as the communication of insights and findings to stakeholders. Data Science draws on techniques and theories from fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science to extract meaningful information from data. The goal of Data Science is to understand patterns, relationships, and insights hidden in the data, and to use this understanding to support decision-making and problem-solving in various domains such as business, healthcare, and social sciences.*

We can also see another definition in this [Video](https://youtu.be/X3paOmcrTjQ).

We could also step back and ask ourselves what science is:

*Science is a systematic and logical **approach to discovering new knowledge**, understanding the natural world, and explaining phenomena. It involves **observing**, **experimenting**, and **testing** to gain insights and develop theories that are based on **evidence** and can be confirmed or disproven through further investigation. Science covers a broad range of disciplines, including physics, biology, chemistry, and earth science, among others.* 

Again as defined by AI.

What the video and other sources show, is that there is no definitive definition for what data scxience is. I've highlighted a few terms in the definitions above and we can begin to see some similarities.

for the purposes of trying to understand what and why we are trying to teach within the *Faculty 0f Biological Sciences* we will use the following definition:

---

**Data Science** Is the application of computational techniques and analyses to answer biological questions

---

I have explicitly stated *biological* questions as ultimately you are studying biology related degrees, but as the definition and video point out, data science is a heavily interdisciplinary field.

We should also heavily reinforce that data science is just another aspect of **science** and that its just another set of skills we need to be better biologists.

Moreover, as we are generating more and more biological [data](https://github.com/mattbawn/MCB_Data_Science/blob/main/Big_Data.md), it is *vital* you have the expertise to understand and use it. 

## Employability

It is also important that you realise that these skills are inceasingly important for employers and there are a lot of data science [jobs](https://builtin.com/data-science).
