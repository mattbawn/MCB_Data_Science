# Bioinformatics *vs* Data Science *vs* Computational Biology 

## Background and Terminology

Many people use data science and bioinformatics interchanagably, and the difference between them can be difficault to grasp. It is therefore, perhaps useful to borrow a definition from the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/bioinformatics-terrified/what-bioinformatics/), or EBI.

**Definition**: Put simply, bioinformatics is the science of storing, retrieving and analysing large amounts of biological information. It is a highly interdisciplinary field involving many different types of specialists, including biologists, molecular life scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians.

We can see, however, that this seem to be very similar to how we defined [**Data Science**}(Intro_Data_Science.md)
