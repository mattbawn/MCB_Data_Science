# Bioinformatics *vs* Data Science *vs* Computational Biology 

## Background and Terminology

Many people use data science and bioinformatics interchanagably, and the difference between them can be difficault to grasp. It is therefore, perhaps useful to borrow a definition from the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/bioinformatics-terrified/what-bioinformatics/), or EBI:

---
*Put simply, bioinformatics is the science of storing, retrieving and analysing large amounts of biological information. It is a highly interdisciplinary field involving many different types of specialists, including biologists, molecular life scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians.*
