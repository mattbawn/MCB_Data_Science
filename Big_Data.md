## Introduction

What is data, why is it useful. Our [AI friend](https://chat.openai.com/) can define data as this:

*Data refers to information or facts, often numerical or descriptive in nature, that are collected, processed, and analyzed to be used for making decisions or drawing conclusions. Data can be in the form of text, numbers, images, or any other format that can be stored, transmitted, and processed by computers.*

But of course, data existed before computers so I would argue that the big at the end about being processed by computers likely refers to [**digital data**](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24872/digital-data) specifically.

At a very basic level what we mean by data is ***any information that we can use to answer a specific question***. Thus our definition of data here could be summed up as *information about X* where X could be anything we have a question or want to investigate.
