# Noteable

[Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) is a web based server that hosts computational notebooks (workbooks). What this means in practice is that it provides a standard environment where you can develop computational analyses and work with computational data.

Some examples of *exemplar* or tutorial analyses can be seen [here](https://github.com/edina/Exemplars2020).
