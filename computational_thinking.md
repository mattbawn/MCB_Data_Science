# Why do we need computation anyway?

## Where we are

We are living in a [digital age](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/the-three-ages-of-digital/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF5HhFPFgNpz2B5m8EQQwmBZ4RtjXhyK64ue92Mm-w1Zq9B_g090gvYQ-yU7sQUlVkOJ-Htu2fzspmoZBGNrjjIOdTwRX8F4OTq33Xki35DTuTBjISsxddYfj5jY10Md4DAyARC9NL3qZLTGS0I9gHlNB2cif9H9cFEqKyqIJSjr). Put simply, we are surrounded by [data](Big_Data.md). 

## Very small steps

[This BBC website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z3tbwmn/articles/zykx6sg) contains a series of resources to introduce children to some concepts in computer science. While it is aimed at Children it does introduce concepts such as **programming**, **algorithms** and **coding** in a clear and straightforward way.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a way of representing an algorithm using informal, natural language that is easier for humans to understand than actual programming code. It is often used as a planning tool for writing actual code. Pseudocode may resemble a programming language, but it is not intended to be executed by a computer. Rather, it is meant to communicate the basic structure and logic of an algorithm in a way that can be easily understood and reviewed by other developers, without the complexities of actual code syntax.

Pseudocode typically uses a mix of English language and simple programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions to outline the steps required to solve a particular problem. It is used to illustrate the logical flow of a program, identify potential issues or edge cases, and facilitate collaboration and communication between team members.
