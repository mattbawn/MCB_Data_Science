# MCB Data Science Resources

## Intro

This repo contains some draft resources to aid instructing first year undergraduate biologics some aspects of data science.

The content has been informed by a round-table discussion on needs in this area for the [School of Molecular and Cellular Biology](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/molecular-and-cellular-biology) at the University of Leeds. 


Key points arising from this discussion are shown below:

**A) What data science skills are currently lacking in students? What skills would be beneficial for students to have, to enable them to do L3 research projects?**
1. Some lack basic skills, for instance effective use of Excel.
2. Very few of our students are able to do scripted data analysis (using R or Python for instance) - this is necessary for ‘omics and any large data set work
3. Very few of our students can work in a command terminal environment and use LINUX – again necessary for omics, large data sets and the effective use of HPC
4. We don’t teach analysis pipelines – e.g. using Galaxy
5. We don’t teach data management – essential in many projects 
6. In the modern World we should give students some appreciation of AI technologies
7. EM and light microscopy teaching would benefit from more image analysis skills
8. We need to teach reproducibility better, and link this with stats teaching. Data science Issues like p-hacking and data dredging need to be covered.
9. Critical data analysis – inference and causality.

**B) What new content should be taught to improve data science skills?**

1.	Understanding importance and impact
2.	Experience variety of data science uses
3.	R and Python
4.	HPC, excel, LINUX, scripts, data mining
5.	Understand data science issues, problems and reproducibility
6.	The integration with statistics teaching is an open question – they are very clearly linked areas
7.	Specific teaching could cover stats and data science relevant to omics and light and electron microscopy and give some experience of working with this data
