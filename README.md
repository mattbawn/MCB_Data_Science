**What data science skills are currently lacking in students? What skills would be beneficial for students to have, to enable them to do L3 research projects?**
1. Some lack basic skills, for instance effective use of Excel.
2. Very few of our students are able to do scripted data analysis (using R or Python for instance) - this is necessary for ‘omics and any large data set work
3. Very few of our students can work in a command terminal environment and use LINUX – again necessary for omics, large data sets and the effective use of HPC
4. We don’t teach analysis pipelines – e.g. using Galaxy
5. We don’t teach data management – essential in many projects 
6. In the modern World we should give students some appreciation of AI technologies
7. EM and light microscopy teaching would benefit from more image analysis skills
8. We need to teach reproducibility better, and link this with stats teaching. Data science Issues like p-hacking and data dredging need to be covered.
9. Critical data analysis – inference and causality.
